WHAT IT IS  & HOW TO WORK WITH IT
This is my first project that i upload on Github, to increase my skill in coding and achieve a better understanding in how to organize properly a code, the core of the work so far stay in launch the program from a terminal in your pc through the cl 'pyhton3 main.py <X>' where in X there is a list of passwords you need to control or an absolute path to the file in your pc.
I strongly reccommend to use the second method, since the code then overwrite the file to don't leave any trace in the local disk.
Hope it work well as it does for me (and have the community suggestion to upgrade this code in future)
